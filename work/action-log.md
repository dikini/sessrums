- Added `BinaryWrapper` and `MPSTWrapper` types to wrap binary and multiparty session types, respectively
- Extended the `Chan` implementation with methods for converting between binary and multiparty session types:
  - Added `convert<Q: Protocol>()` method to convert a channel to use a different protocol type
  - Added `for_role<S: Role>()` method to create a channel for a different role with the same protocol and IO
  - Added `with_role()` method to create a channel with a specific role instance
- Implemented the `ChanCompat` trait with `to_binary()` and `from_binary()` methods for converting channels
- Updated `src/proto/mod.rs` to include the new `compat` module in the public API
- Created integration tests in `tests/mpst_channel_integration_tests.rs` to verify the backward compatibility functionality

## Task 7.1: Compile-Time Tests

- Created compile-time tests in `tests/compile_fail/` to verify that invalid MPST protocols fail to compile:
  - `mpst_error_1.rs`: Tests that a global protocol with the same role as sender and receiver fails to compile
  - `mpst_error_2.rs`: Tests that a global protocol with an unknown role in projection fails to compile
- Added corresponding `.stderr` files to specify the expected error messages
- Tests verify that the type system correctly enforces MPST protocol constraints
- All compile-time tests pass, confirming that invalid MPST protocols fail to compile with the expected error messages

  - Multiple roles (Client, Server, Logger)
  - Global protocol definition using the macro
  - Projection to local protocols
  - Branching and choice

- **Fix Unused Imports:** Removed specific unused import items from `sessrums-macro/src/lib.rs` (lines 9-14), the entire import line from `src/proto/projection.rs` (line 16), and specific unused import items from `src/api.rs` (line 22). Verified fixes with `cargo check`.
- **Enhance `global_protocol!` Macro:** Modified `sessrums-macro/src/lib.rs` to parse optional `role RoleName;` definitions and generate corresponding structs implementing `::sessrums::proto::roles::Role`. Added tests in `tests/macro_tests.rs` to verify the new functionality, including refactoring tests to invoke the macro at the module level for correct type resolution. Used absolute path `::sessrums::proto::roles::Role` in macro expansion to fix path issues during testing.
- Updated docstrings in `src/proto/global.rs` to improve clarity, add examples, and accurately reflect the placeholder status of `validate`, `involved_roles`, and `project_for_role` methods based on documentation review findings.
