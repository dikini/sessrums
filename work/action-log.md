  - Created proto/recv.rs with Recv<T, P> type definition
  - Documented Recv<T, P> type with examples
  - Added unit tests for Recv<T, P> type

- Completed Task 1.5: Implement End Type

All tests are passing, confirming that the core type definitions and duality relationships are correctly implemented.

## 2025-04-26: Started Phase 2 - Channel Abstraction & Basic IO Traits

- Completed Task 2.1: Define Basic IO Traits
  - Created src/io.rs with Sender<T> and Receiver<T> traits
  - Documented IO traits with comprehensive examples
  - Added unit tests for IO traits, including custom implementations and thread-based tests
  - Updated src/lib.rs to export the io module
  - Fixed doctest examples to use local types instead of foreign types

- Completed Task 2.2: Define Channel Type
  - Created src/chan/mod.rs with Chan<P: Protocol, IO> type definition
  - Documented Chan type thoroughly with examples
  - Added unit tests for Chan type, including tests for creation and IO access
  - Ensured the Chan type works with the Protocol trait and IO traits
  - Fixed conflicts with existing trait implementations

- Completed Task 2.3: Implement Offer Type
  - Created src/proto/offer.rs with Offer<L, R> type definition
  - Created a placeholder for Choose<L, R> in src/proto/choose.rs
  - Implemented Protocol trait for Offer<L, R> with Choose<L::Dual, R::Dual> as its dual
  - Documented Offer<L, R> type thoroughly with examples
  - Added unit tests for Offer<L, R> type, including tests for duality relationships
  - Updated src/proto/mod.rs to export the Offer type
  - Ensured all tests pass, confirming the Offer type is correctly implemented

- Completed Task 2.4: Implement Choose Type
  - Updated src/proto/choose.rs with the full Choose<L, R> type definition
  - Implemented Protocol trait for Choose<L, R> with Offer<L::Dual, R::Dual> as its dual
  - Documented Choose<L, R> type thoroughly with examples
  - Added unit tests for Choose<L, R> type, including tests for duality relationships
  - Updated src/proto/mod.rs to export the Choose type
  - Ensured all tests pass, confirming the Choose type is correctly implemented

- Completed Task 2.5: Implement Duality for Offer and Choose
  - Enabled the previously commented-out duality symmetry test in offer.rs
  - Added comprehensive tests for the duality relationship between Offer and Choose:
    - Tests for nested Offer and Choose types
    - Tests for multiple levels of duality (dual of dual, dual of dual of dual)
    - Tests for complex protocol compositions involving Offer and Choose
  - Enhanced documentation for the duality relationship between Offer and Choose:
    - Added detailed explanations of the duality transformation rules
    - Added examples of duality with simple and nested types
    - Documented the symmetry property of duality
  - Ensured all tests pass, confirming the duality relationship is correctly implemented
