# Action Log

## 2025-04-26: Completed Phase 1 - Core Type Definitions & Duality

- Completed Task 1.1: Project Setup
  - Initialized Cargo.toml
  - Created directory structure
  - Created lib.rs and proto/mod.rs

- Completed Task 1.2: Define Protocol Trait
  - Created proto/proto.rs with Protocol trait definition
  - Documented Protocol trait with examples
  - Added unit tests for Protocol trait functionality

- Completed Task 1.3: Implement Send Type
  - Created proto/send.rs with Send<T, P> type definition
  - Documented Send<T, P> type with examples
  - Added unit tests for Send<T, P> type

- Completed Task 1.4: Implement Recv Type
  - Created proto/recv.rs with Recv<T, P> type definition
  - Documented Recv<T, P> type with examples
  - Added unit tests for Recv<T, P> type

- Completed Task 1.5: Implement End Type
  - Created proto/end.rs with End type definition
  - Documented End type with examples
  - Added unit tests for End type

- Completed Task 1.6: Implement Duality for Basic Types
  - Implemented Dual associated type for Send<T, P>, Recv<T, P>, and End
  - Documented duality relationships with examples
  - Added unit tests verifying duality relationships

All tests are passing, confirming that the core type definitions and duality relationships are correctly implemented.

## 2025-04-26: Started Phase 2 - Channel Abstraction & Basic IO Traits

- Completed Task 2.1: Define Basic IO Traits
  - Created src/io.rs with Sender<T> and Receiver<T> traits
  - Documented IO traits with comprehensive examples
  - Added unit tests for IO traits, including custom implementations and thread-based tests
  - Updated src/lib.rs to export the io module
  - Fixed doctest examples to use local types instead of foreign types

- Completed Task 2.2: Define Channel Type
  - Created src/chan/mod.rs with Chan<P: Protocol, IO> type definition
  - Documented Chan type thoroughly with examples
  - Added unit tests for Chan type, including tests for creation and IO access
  - Ensured the Chan type works with the Protocol trait and IO traits
  - Fixed conflicts with existing trait implementations

- Completed Task 2.3: Implement Offer Type
  - Created src/proto/offer.rs with Offer<L, R> type definition
  - Created a placeholder for Choose<L, R> in src/proto/choose.rs
  - Implemented Protocol trait for Offer<L, R> with Choose<L::Dual, R::Dual> as its dual
  - Documented Offer<L, R> type thoroughly with examples
  - Added unit tests for Offer<L, R> type, including tests for duality relationships
  - Updated src/proto/mod.rs to export the Offer type
  - Ensured all tests pass, confirming the Offer type is correctly implemented
