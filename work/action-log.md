# Action Log

## 2025-04-26: Added Phase 2.5 - Example Protocol Implementations

- Updated project plan to include new Phase 2.5 for example protocol implementations
- Added detailed tasks for implementing protocol examples
- Created test infrastructure for protocol examples
  - Set up integration test directory structure
  - Set up compile-fail test infrastructure with trybuild
- Added trybuild as a dev-dependency for compile-fail tests
- Created placeholder examples for protocols and compile-fail tests
- Updated Cargo.toml with necessary dev-dependencies

## 2025-04-26: Completed Phase 2 - Channel Abstraction & Basic IO Traits

- Completed Task 2.1: Define Basic IO Traits
  - Created src/io.rs with Sender<T> and Receiver<T> traits
  - Documented IO traits with examples
  - Added unit tests for IO traits

- Completed Task 2.2: Define Channel Type
  - Created src/chan/mod.rs with Chan<P: Protocol, IO> type definition
  - Documented Chan type with examples
  - Added unit tests for Chan type

- Completed Task 2.3: Implement Offer Type
  - Created src/proto/offer.rs with Offer<L, R> type definition
  - Implemented Protocol trait for Offer<L, R>
  - Created placeholder for Choose type
  - Documented Offer type with examples
  - Added unit tests for Offer type

- Completed Task 2.4: Implement Choose Type
  - Updated src/proto/choose.rs with Choose<L, R> type definition
  - Implemented Protocol trait for Choose<L, R>
  - Documented Choose type with examples
  - Added unit tests for Choose type

- Completed Task 2.5: Implement Duality for Offer and Choose
  - Verified duality relationship between Offer and Choose
  - Added comprehensive tests for duality
  - Enhanced documentation for duality relationship

All tests are passing (35 unit tests and 21 doc-tests), confirming that the Channel abstraction and basic IO traits are correctly implemented.

- Completed Task 1.4: Implement Recv Type
  - Created proto/recv.rs with Recv<T, P> type definition
  - Documented Recv<T, P> type with examples
  - Added unit tests for Recv<T, P> type

- Completed Task 1.5: Implement End Type
  - Created proto/end.rs with End type definition
  - Documented End type with examples
  - Added unit tests for End type

- Completed Task 1.6: Implement Duality for Basic Types
  - Implemented Dual associated type for Send<T, P>, Recv<T, P>, and End
