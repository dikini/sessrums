### Technical Insights
- The session type system uses the Rust type system to enforce protocol adherence at compile time
- Duality is a key concept in session types, ensuring communication compatibility between parties
- The `End` type is symmetric in its duality (End::Dual = End), unlike `Send` and `Recv` which are duals of each other
- Testing type-level relationships in Rust requires creative approaches since types can't be directly compared at runtime
- Using empty generic functions with trait bounds is an effective way to verify type relationships at compile time

### Design Patterns
- The Protocol trait uses the type system to enforce communication protocol adherence
- The composition pattern allows building complex protocols from simpler ones (e.g., Send<T, Recv<U, End>>)
- Using PhantomData in protocol types allows carrying type information without runtime overhead
- Test functions that only check compile-time properties don't need runtime assertions

### Best Practices
- Testing type-level properties through compilation success/failure is a powerful technique
- Comprehensive testing of type compositions ensures the type system works as expected
- Documenting duality relationships clearly helps users understand the session type system
- Separating test cases by functionality improves test organization and readability
