# Summary of MPST Development Insights (work/insights.md)

This document summarizes key technical insights, design decisions, and future considerations gathered during the development of the `sessrums` MPST library, focusing on recursion, composition, macros, channel implementation, compatibility, examples, documentation, and testing.

## Core Feature Implementation Insights

1.  **Recursion (Task 3.2):**
    *   **Technical:** Implemented using phantom types (`PhantomData`) and label types to manage recursive references and avoid circular dependencies. Projection preserves recursive structure. Overcame `Default` trait orphan rule issues. Testing required type-level assertions.
    *   **Design:** Increased expressiveness significantly but also complexity. Label types ensure type safety. Separated structure (`GRec`, `GVar`) from behavior (projection). Highlighted the need for clear documentation.
    *   **Future:** Track recursion depth, implement robust validation (termination/productivity), and explore optimizations.

2.  **Process Composition (Task 3.3):**
    *   **Technical:** Introduced `GSeq` and `GPar` types using phantom data. Projection logic currently simplified; a full implementation needs local protocol composition types. Builder pattern aided construction.
    *   **Design:** Enhanced expressiveness but increased implementation complexity (esp. projection). Composition treated as first-class, type-level concepts for static verification. Clear documentation is vital.
    *   **Future:** Implement local protocol composition types, enhance validation (deadlocks/races), optimize (esp. parallel), and support n-ary composition.

3.  **Macro DSL (Tasks 4.1 & 4.2):**
    *   **Technical:** Created a DSL inspired by sequence diagrams using procedural macros (`syn`, `quote`). Required parsing custom syntax, generating complex nested types, and transforming ASTs. Recursive parsing added complexity. Addressed macro path resolution issues (`::crate_name::` preferred) and invocation scope visibility.
    *   **Design:** Balanced readability and expressiveness. Visual syntax (arrows, indentation) aids understanding. Hierarchical structure mirrors diagrams. Implicit sequential, explicit parallel composition. Improved ergonomics significantly while preserving type safety. Good error handling (`syn`) is crucial.
    *   **Future:** Enhance error reporting, improve IDE support, explore documentation/visualization generation from macros, integrate more sophisticated verification, optimize compile times, and potentially extend syntax.

4.  **Channel Implementation & Roles (Task 5.1):**
    *   **Technical:** Extended `Chan` with a role parameter (`R`), requiring careful propagation through operations (`send`, `recv`, etc.). Managed backward compatibility impact. Testing required multi-role scenarios.
    *   **Design:** Made roles a first-class concept, enhancing type safety and explicitness (`role()` method). Maintained separation of concerns (Protocol `P`, Role `R`, IO `IO`).
    *   **Future:** Add role-based validation, dynamic role discovery, role-specific operations, access control, and distributed implementations.

5.  **Backward Compatibility (Binary <-> MPST) (Task 5.2):**
    *   **Technical:** Created a compatibility layer (`ProtocolCompat`, `BinaryWrapper`, `MPSTWrapper`) using type wrappers and channel conversion methods, preserving roles and type safety.
    *   **Design:** Provided a gradual migration path, allowed feature composition, established clear abstraction boundaries, and improved API ergonomics (`ChanCompat`).
    *   **Future:** Explore automatic conversion, optimize performance, extend compatibility for complex interactions, and improve documentation/examples.

## Development Process & Quality Insights

6.  **Examples & Documentation (Tasks 6.1 & 6.2):**
    *   **Technical:** Examples progressed in complexity, used real-world scenarios, addressed IO implementation challenges, and were thoroughly tested. Documentation required logical structure, embedded code examples, cross-referencing, and detailed API docs.
    *   **Design:** Examples serve as executable documentation ("docs as code") using progressive disclosure and consistent style. Documentation is user-centered, consistent with code, uses visual aids, and offers multiple entry points.
    *   **Future (Examples):** Interactive examples, more complex scenarios, performance/integration examples.
    *   **Future (Docs):** Interactive elements, video tutorials, case studies, community contributions.

7.  **Testing Strategy (Tasks 7.1, 7.2, 7.3):**
    *   **Technical (Compile-Time):** Used `trybuild` to test type errors, focusing on stable fundamental errors. Designed isolated test cases and aimed for clear compiler error messages.
    *   **Technical (Runtime):** Used mock IO (`MockIO`) and async testing (`tokio`). Verified message order/values and tested error conditions.
    *   **Technical (Integration):** Combined all features (roles, projection, branching, recursion, composition) in complex, realistic scenarios, requiring careful test structure and verification. Highlighted importance of precise import removal (`use a::{b, c};`) to avoid breaking builds.
    *   **Design:** Compile-time tests act as type system documentation (error-driven). Runtime tests focus on behavior, progressing in complexity and isolating features. Integration tests verify feature interactions in realistic scenarios, building confidence.
    *   **Future:** Explore property-based testing, performance/stress/fuzz testing, add more error cases/integration scenarios, improve error messages, and integrate tests with documentation.
- **Docstring Accuracy:** It's crucial for docstrings to accurately reflect the current implementation status of functions/methods. Explicitly stating when a method is a placeholder or incomplete (e.g., `validate`, `involved_roles` in `global.rs`) prevents confusion and sets correct expectations for users of the code. Documentation should evolve alongside the code.
- **Placeholder Management:** Placeholder implementations (`Ok(())`, `vec![]`, `unimplemented!()`) are useful during development but must be clearly documented. Relying solely on code comments inside the function body is insufficient; the public-facing documentation (docstrings) must also reflect this status.
- **Projection Logic Incompleteness:** Reviewing and documenting `src/proto/projection.rs` highlighted significant limitations in the current projection logic, especially for `GSeq` and `GPar`. The current implementations are placeholders and do not correctly project these constructs. This needs to be addressed in the implementation itself.
- **Projection Simplifications:** The projection for `GVar` currently uses a `Var<0>` simplification. While sufficient for basic recursion, this needs refinement for nested recursion or more complex variable binding scenarios. Explicitly documenting this simplification is crucial for users.
- **Docstring Clarity:** Clear docstrings explaining *how* projection works for each type and *what* its limitations are is essential for understanding the session type system's capabilities and current state. The previous lack of detail obscured the implementation gaps.
## Docstring Enhancement Insights (src/chan/mod.rs)

*   **Conflicting Documentation:** Found conflicting docstrings for the `Chan` struct and `Chan::new` method. This highlights the importance of keeping documentation synchronized with code implementation, especially regarding struct fields and constructor signatures. Resolving these required careful comparison with the actual code.
*   **Value of Examples:** Adding concrete usage examples significantly improves the usability of the library. The core channel methods (`send`, `recv`, `offer`, `choose`, etc.) benefit greatly from examples demonstrating their use within a typical session type flow, including necessary IO setup (even if simplified for the example). Async examples using `tokio::main` and `async fn` are crucial for async methods.
*   **Feature Status Clarity:** Explicitly marking features like `Inc`/`Dec` with their current status (e.g., `[Currently disabled]`) in the docstring itself, rather than just in comments, provides clearer information to users browsing the documentation.
*   **Tooling (`apply_diff`):** The `apply_diff` tool is effective for targeted docstring updates. However, multiple sequential diffs can sometimes lead to line number mismatches if not carefully managed. Re-reading the file (`read_file`) after a failed diff application is necessary to get the correct line numbers for subsequent attempts.
*   **Scope Management:** Focusing solely on docstrings as requested, without altering code logic, requires discipline but ensures the task remains focused and avoids unintended side effects.
- **Docstrings for Connection Logic:** Clearly documenting the serialization format (e.g., `bincode` with length prefix) and providing concrete usage examples for connection setup functions (`connect`, `accept`, `connect_with_protocol`) and wrappers (`StreamWrapper`, `ConnectInfo`) is crucial for usability. Users need to understand both *how* to establish a connection and *what* happens on the wire.
