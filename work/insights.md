# Summary of MPST Development Insights (work/insights.md)

This document summarizes key technical insights, design decisions, and future considerations gathered during the development of the `sessrums` MPST library, focusing on recursion, composition, macros, channel implementation, compatibility, examples, documentation, and testing.

## Core Feature Implementation Insights

1.  **Recursion (Task 3.2):**
    *   **Technical:** Implemented using phantom types (`PhantomData`) and label types to manage recursive references and avoid circular dependencies. Projection preserves recursive structure. Overcame `Default` trait orphan rule issues. Testing required type-level assertions.
    *   **Design:** Increased expressiveness significantly but also complexity. Label types ensure type safety. Separated structure (`GRec`, `GVar`) from behavior (projection). Highlighted the need for clear documentation.
    *   **Future:** Track recursion depth, implement robust validation (termination/productivity), and explore optimizations.

2.  **Process Composition (Task 3.3):**
    *   **Technical:** Introduced `GSeq` and `GPar` types using phantom data. Projection logic currently simplified; a full implementation needs local protocol composition types. Builder pattern aided construction.
    *   **Design:** Enhanced expressiveness but increased implementation complexity (esp. projection). Composition treated as first-class, type-level concepts for static verification. Clear documentation is vital.
    *   **Future:** Implement local protocol composition types, enhance validation (deadlocks/races), optimize (esp. parallel), and support n-ary composition.

3.  **Macro DSL (Tasks 4.1 & 4.2):**
    *   **Technical:** Created a DSL inspired by sequence diagrams using procedural macros (`syn`, `quote`). Required parsing custom syntax, generating complex nested types, and transforming ASTs. Recursive parsing added complexity. Addressed macro path resolution issues (`::crate_name::` preferred) and invocation scope visibility.
    *   **Design:** Balanced readability and expressiveness. Visual syntax (arrows, indentation) aids understanding. Hierarchical structure mirrors diagrams. Implicit sequential, explicit parallel composition. Improved ergonomics significantly while preserving type safety. Good error handling (`syn`) is crucial.
    *   **Future:** Enhance error reporting, improve IDE support, explore documentation/visualization generation from macros, integrate more sophisticated verification, optimize compile times, and potentially extend syntax.

4.  **Channel Implementation & Roles (Task 5.1):**
    *   **Technical:** Extended `Chan` with a role parameter (`R`), requiring careful propagation through operations (`send`, `recv`, etc.). Managed backward compatibility impact. Testing required multi-role scenarios.
    *   **Design:** Made roles a first-class concept, enhancing type safety and explicitness (`role()` method). Maintained separation of concerns (Protocol `P`, Role `R`, IO `IO`).
    *   **Future:** Add role-based validation, dynamic role discovery, role-specific operations, access control, and distributed implementations.

5.  **Backward Compatibility (Binary <-> MPST) (Task 5.2):**
    *   **Technical:** Created a compatibility layer (`ProtocolCompat`, `BinaryWrapper`, `MPSTWrapper`) using type wrappers and channel conversion methods, preserving roles and type safety.
    *   **Design:** Provided a gradual migration path, allowed feature composition, established clear abstraction boundaries, and improved API ergonomics (`ChanCompat`).
    *   **Future:** Explore automatic conversion, optimize performance, extend compatibility for complex interactions, and improve documentation/examples.

## Development Process & Quality Insights

6.  **Examples & Documentation (Tasks 6.1 & 6.2):**
    *   **Technical:** Examples progressed in complexity, used real-world scenarios, addressed IO implementation challenges, and were thoroughly tested. Documentation required logical structure, embedded code examples, cross-referencing, and detailed API docs.
    *   **Design:** Examples serve as executable documentation ("docs as code") using progressive disclosure and consistent style. Documentation is user-centered, consistent with code, uses visual aids, and offers multiple entry points.
    *   **Future (Examples):** Interactive examples, more complex scenarios, performance/integration examples.
    *   **Future (Docs):** Interactive elements, video tutorials, case studies, community contributions.

7.  **Testing Strategy (Tasks 7.1, 7.2, 7.3):**
    *   **Technical (Compile-Time):** Used `trybuild` to test type errors, focusing on stable fundamental errors. Designed isolated test cases and aimed for clear compiler error messages.
    *   **Technical (Runtime):** Used mock IO (`MockIO`) and async testing (`tokio`). Verified message order/values and tested error conditions.
    *   **Technical (Integration):** Combined all features (roles, projection, branching, recursion, composition) in complex, realistic scenarios, requiring careful test structure and verification. Highlighted importance of precise import removal (`use a::{b, c};`) to avoid breaking builds.
    *   **Design:** Compile-time tests act as type system documentation (error-driven). Runtime tests focus on behavior, progressing in complexity and isolating features. Integration tests verify feature interactions in realistic scenarios, building confidence.
    *   **Future:** Explore property-based testing, performance/stress/fuzz testing, add more error cases/integration scenarios, improve error messages, and integrate tests with documentation.
- **Docstring Accuracy:** It's crucial for docstrings to accurately reflect the current implementation status of functions/methods. Explicitly stating when a method is a placeholder or incomplete (e.g., `validate`, `involved_roles` in `global.rs`) prevents confusion and sets correct expectations for users of the code. Documentation should evolve alongside the code.
- **Placeholder Management:** Placeholder implementations (`Ok(())`, `vec![]`, `unimplemented!()`) are useful during development but must be clearly documented. Relying solely on code comments inside the function body is insufficient; the public-facing documentation (docstrings) must also reflect this status.
- **Projection Logic Incompleteness:** Reviewing and documenting `src/proto/projection.rs` highlighted significant limitations in the current projection logic, especially for `GSeq` and `GPar`. The current implementations are placeholders and do not correctly project these constructs. This needs to be addressed in the implementation itself.
- **Projection Simplifications:** The projection for `GVar` currently uses a `Var<0>` simplification. While sufficient for basic recursion, this needs refinement for nested recursion or more complex variable binding scenarios. Explicitly documenting this simplification is crucial for users.
- **Docstring Clarity:** Clear docstrings explaining *how* projection works for each type and *what* its limitations are is essential for understanding the session type system's capabilities and current state. The previous lack of detail obscured the implementation gaps.
## Docstring Enhancement Insights (src/chan/mod.rs)

*   **Conflicting Documentation:** Found conflicting docstrings for the `Chan` struct and `Chan::new` method. This highlights the importance of keeping documentation synchronized with code implementation, especially regarding struct fields and constructor signatures. Resolving these required careful comparison with the actual code.
*   **Value of Examples:** Adding concrete usage examples significantly improves the usability of the library. The core channel methods (`send`, `recv`, `offer`, `choose`, etc.) benefit greatly from examples demonstrating their use within a typical session type flow, including necessary IO setup (even if simplified for the example). Async examples using `tokio::main` and `async fn` are crucial for async methods.
*   **Feature Status Clarity:** Explicitly marking features like `Inc`/`Dec` with their current status (e.g., `[Currently disabled]`) in the docstring itself, rather than just in comments, provides clearer information to users browsing the documentation.
*   **Tooling (`apply_diff`):** The `apply_diff` tool is effective for targeted docstring updates. However, multiple sequential diffs can sometimes lead to line number mismatches if not carefully managed. Re-reading the file (`read_file`) after a failed diff application is necessary to get the correct line numbers for subsequent attempts.
*   **Scope Management:** Focusing solely on docstrings as requested, without altering code logic, requires discipline but ensures the task remains focused and avoids unintended side effects.
- **Docstrings for Connection Logic:** Clearly documenting the serialization format (e.g., `bincode` with length prefix) and providing concrete usage examples for connection setup functions (`connect`, `accept`, `connect_with_protocol`) and wrappers (`StreamWrapper`, `ConnectInfo`) is crucial for usability. Users need to understand both *how* to establish a connection and *what* happens on the wire.
- The `protocol_pair!` macro, while defined, lacks dedicated test coverage in the expected location (`tests/macro_tests.rs`). This highlights a potential gap in testing or documentation accuracy. Documentation reports should be cross-verified with the actual codebase state. The absence of tests makes it difficult to ascertain the macro's stability or intended usage status. Added a warning to its docstring.
- `cargo fix` is highly effective for resolving `unused_imports` and simple `unused_variables` warnings.
- `dead_code` warnings, particularly involving type aliases or structs within test modules (`#[cfg(test)]`), often require manual removal as `cargo fix` may not address them automatically.
- Multiple runs of `cargo fix` might be necessary, especially after manual changes, to catch newly introduced warnings (like unused imports resulting from dead code removal).
- The `unconditional_recursion` warning can appear in `Default` implementations for recursive types used in tests, which might be acceptable depending on the test's purpose.
- **2025-04-28:** Regularly addressing compiler warnings and fixing failing tests (including doctests) is crucial for maintaining codebase health and preventing regressions. Keeping documentation synchronized with code changes ensures accuracy and usability. Committing these related changes together provides a clear history of maintenance and improvement efforts.
- Conflicting `Default` implementations in `src/proto/projection.rs` (related to `GSend` in tests) prevent `cargo clippy --fix` and `cargo test` from running successfully. These need manual resolution, potentially by adjusting the test setup or the generic `Default` implementation in `src/proto/global.rs`.
- A new compilation error (`E0404`) appeared in `examples/send_trait.rs` after the initial clippy fixes, indicating a potential issue with trait imports or usage (`std::marker::Send` vs `crate::proto::Send`). This also needs manual investigation.
- The `module_inception` and `type_complexity` warnings remain, requiring structural changes or type aliasing for resolution.
## Clippy Fixes (Module Inception, Dead Code)

- **Module Inception:** The `clippy::module_inception` lint occurs when a module file (e.g., `proto.rs`) has the same name as its parent directory's `mod.rs` declaration (`mod proto;`). The standard fix is to rename the inner file (e.g., to `base.rs` or similar) and update the `mod` declaration in `mod.rs` accordingly. This avoids ambiguity and improves clarity.
- **Iterative Fixing:** Running `cargo clippy --fix` first handles many simple, safe fixes automatically. Manually addressing remaining warnings afterwards, focusing on safe ones like `dead_code` and structural issues like `module_inception`, is an effective workflow. Complex warnings like `type_complexity` can be deferred or addressed separately if they require significant refactoring.
- **Test Verification:** Always run tests (`cargo test --all-targets`) after applying clippy fixes, especially manual ones, to catch any regressions introduced by the changes.
