# Plan to Fix Rust Compilation Errors

## Goal

Address the compilation errors reported by `cargo test` to allow the project to compile successfully. Warnings will be ignored for this plan.

## Error Analysis Summary

The `cargo test` output shows several types of compilation errors:

1.  **E0119 (Conflicting Trait Implementations):** Multiple conflicting implementations of the `Role` trait for the `ProtocolChannel` type, originating from `examples/async.rs:888` but causing errors across many files due to `#![deny(warnings)]`.
2.  **E0107 (Incorrect Generic Argument Count):** The `Chan` struct is instantiated with 2 generic arguments instead of the expected 3 in `examples/async.rs`.
3.  **E0277 (Trait Bound Not Satisfied):** Various trait bounds are not met:
    *   `ProtocolChannel: Role` (likely related to E0119).
    *   `MockIO<_>: AsyncReceiver<_>` / `AsyncSender<_>` in tests.
    *   `GChoice<...>: Project<...>` / `GSend<...>: Project<...>` in runtime tests.
    *   `{integer}: PartialEq<&str>` in a test assertion.
4.  **E0599 (Method/Associated Item Not Found):**
    *   Missing `::new()` associated function for `Send`, `Recv`, `End` structs in `src/proto/compat.rs`.
    *   Missing `protocol_name()` method for `BinaryWrapper` and `MPSTWrapper` in `src/proto/compat.rs`.
    *   Methods like `recv`, `choose_left`, `offer` on `Chan` exist but cannot be called due to unsatisfied trait bounds (linked to E0277).

## Proposed Fix Plan (Prioritized)

The plan addresses errors starting with the most fundamental issues that likely impact others.

**1. Resolve `Role` Trait Conflicts (E0119 & related E0277)**

*   **Problem:** The core issue seems to be how `ProtocolChannel` relates to the `Role` trait hierarchy (`Role`, `RoleA`, `RoleB`). The implementation `impl Role for ProtocolChannel` in `examples/async.rs:888` conflicts across the project.
*   **Action:**
    *   Analyze the intended design for `ProtocolChannel` and its role. Should it implement the generic `Role`, or specific roles like `RoleA` or `RoleB`?
    *   Investigate if the `impl Role for ProtocolChannel` block in `examples/async.rs` is correctly defined and placed. It might need modification (e.g., implement `RoleA` or `RoleB` instead) or relocation to a more central place if it's intended to be canonical.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Resolving E0119 should also fix the numerous E0277 errors related to `ProtocolChannel: Role`.

**2. Fix Generic Argument Counts (E0107)**

*   **Problem:** The `Chan` struct requires 3 generic arguments (`P: Protocol`, `R: Role`, `IO`), but is called with only 2 in several places.
*   **Action:**
    *   Locate the `Chan::<...>` instantiations in `examples/async.rs` (lines 895, 910, 974, 975).
    *   Add the missing third generic argument (likely the `IO` type, e.g., `ProtocolChannel` or a specific IO type).
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Resolves E0107 errors.

**3. Address Remaining Trait Bound Issues (E0277)**

*   **Problem:** Various types (`MockIO`, `GChoice`, `GSend`, `{integer}`) do not satisfy required trait bounds (`AsyncReceiver`, `AsyncSender`, `Project`, `PartialEq`).
*   **Action:**
    *   **`MockIO`:** Implement the required `AsyncReceiver<T>` and `AsyncSender<T>` traits for the specific types (`i32`, `bool`) needed by `tests/mpst_channel_tests.rs` and `tests/runtime_tests.rs`. This might involve adding stub implementations to the `MockIO` struct definition.
    *   **`Project` Trait:** Review the `Project<R>` trait implementation for `GChoice` and `GSend` (likely in `src/proto/projection.rs` or `src/proto/mod.rs`). Ensure the projection logic correctly handles the complex types used in `tests/runtime_tests.rs:210` and `tests/runtime_tests.rs:211`.
    *   **`assert_eq!`:** Correct the type mismatch in the assertion at `tests/runtime_tests.rs:216`. Ensure both sides of the comparison have compatible types.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Resolves the remaining E0277 errors. This should also implicitly fix the E0599 errors related to `Chan` methods (`recv`, `choose_left`, `offer`) being unusable due to these bounds.

**4. Fix Missing Methods/Associated Items (E0599)**

*   **Problem:** Calls to non-existent associated functions (`::new`) or methods (`protocol_name`).
*   **Action:**
    *   **`::new()`:** Determine the correct way to instantiate `Send<T, P>`, `Recv<T, P>`, and `End` structs within `src/proto/compat.rs`. These structs might be instantiated directly (e.g., `End`) or require different constructor logic. Remove the incorrect `.new()` calls.
    *   **`protocol_name()`:** Implement the `GlobalProtocol` trait (which presumably defines `protocol_name()`) for the `BinaryWrapper` and `MPSTWrapper` structs defined in `src/proto/compat.rs`.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Resolves E0599 errors related to missing items.

## Next Steps

This plan provides a structured approach to fixing the compilation errors. The next step would be to implement these changes, likely starting with Priority 1.
