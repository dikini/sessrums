I want to develop a rust library that is based on multiparty session types. I will be used to statically ensure that communications code adheres to protocol specifications. To achieve this I want the library to:
* provide generic types for protocols, communication roles, interactions, channels
* channels and interactions should be parametrised by IO, for example http, mqtt, https-sse, ....
* the library should contain primitives to project global protocols to local, role specific protocols
* it would be helpful to develop macros from a 'mermaid' like dsl to global protocol types
Help me craft a prompt for the above spec
Edit

I'll help you craft a detailed prompt for developing your Rust library based on multiparty session types. This is an excellent project that bridges formal verification with practical communication protocols.

Here's a comprehensive prompt crafted specifically for your needs:
Rust Library Development: Multiparty Session Types for Protocol Verification

I'm developing a Rust library that implements multiparty session types to statically verify that communication code adheres to protocol specifications. I need assistance with designing the architecture and API for this library.
Core Requirements

    Type System Architecture
        Design generic types for protocols, roles, interactions, and channels
        Implement session type theory with Rust's type system
        Ensure compile-time protocol conformance verification
    Protocol Representation
        Create a global protocol representation system
        Implement projection mechanisms to derive local (role-specific) protocols
        Support branching, recursion, and parallel composition in protocols
    Transport Abstraction
        Design channels and interactions parametrized by IO backends
        Support multiple transports (HTTP, MQTT, WebSockets, SSE, etc.)
        Provide a clean abstraction that separates protocol logic from transport details
    DSL and Macros
        Develop a Mermaid-like DSL for specifying global protocols
        Create macros to transform DSL specifications into type-level representations

Technical Approach

Please help with designing:

    A type-level representation of session types using Rust's generic system
    An approach to enforce linear usage of communication channels
    A strategy for protocol projection from global to local views
    Transport-agnostic channel abstractions with concrete implementations
    Procedural macros for the DSL parser and code generator

Specific Questions

    How can I represent recursive session types in Rust's type system?
    What's the best approach to handle protocol branching with static verification?
    How should I design the transport abstraction for maximum flexibility?
    What would be an elegant DSL syntax for specifying multiparty protocols?

Example Use Case

I'd like to see how a simple protocol (e.g., a three-party file transfer protocol) would be:

    Specified in the DSL
    Represented as global and local types
    Implemented by client code using the library

Similar Work

I'm aware of:

    Scribble language for multiparty session types
    The Rusty Variation (Rumpsteak) project
    Session types for Go (GoScr)

But I'm specifically looking to create a Rust-native approach that leverages Rust's type system for maximum static safety with minimal runtime overhead.

How can I represent recursive session types in Rust's type system?
Edit
Representing Recursive Session Types in Rust's Type System

Implementing recursive session types in Rust presents an interesting challenge due to Rust's strict ownership model and lack of direct support for recursive types. Here are several approaches you could take:
1. Using Indirection with Box

The most straightforward approach is to use Box to create the necessary indirection for recursive types:

rust

enum Protocol<R> {
    Send {
        message_type: MessageType,
        continuation: Box<Protocol<R>>,
    },
    Receive {
        message_type: MessageType,
        continuation: Box<Protocol<R>>,
    },
    Rec {
        variable: TypeVar,
        body: Box<Protocol<R>>,
    },
    Var(TypeVar),
    End,
}

This works but doesn't provide compile-time guarantees about protocol conformance by itself.
2. Type-Level State Machines

A more advanced approach is to encode the protocol as a type-level state machine:

rust

// Protocol states as zero-sized marker types
struct Init;
struct WaitingForResponse;
struct Done;

// Type-parameterized channel
struct Channel<S, R, N> {
    // S: Current state
    // R: Role
    // N: Next state after transition
    connection: Connection,
    _phantom: PhantomData<(S, R, N)>,
}

// Methods only available in specific states
impl<R, N> Channel<Init, R, N> {
    pub fn send_request(self) -> Channel<WaitingForResponse, R, N> {
        // Implementation...
    }
}

impl<R, N> Channel<WaitingForResponse, R, N> {
    pub fn receive_response(self) -> Channel<Done, R, N> {
        // Implementation...
    }
}

3. Advanced: Using HRTBs and Continuation-Passing Style

For truly recursive protocols, you might need higher-ranked trait bounds and continuation-passing style:

rust

trait Rec<C: Context> {
    type Unfold: Protocol<C>;
    
    fn unfold(self) -> Self::Unfold;
}

// μX.Protocol definition 
struct Mu<F>(PhantomData<F>);

impl<F, C> Protocol<C> for Mu<F>
where
    F: FnOnce(Mu<F>) -> Box<dyn Protocol<C>>,
{
    type Continue = ();
    
    fn execute(self, context: &mut C) -> Self::Continue {
        let protocol = F(self);
        protocol.execute(context)
    }
}

4. Session Type Combinators with Fixed Points

You can define a combinator library that includes fixed-point operators:

rust

struct Fix<F>(F);

trait Unfold {
    type Unfolded;
    fn unfold(self) -> Self::Unfolded;
}

impl<F, P> Unfold for Fix<F>
where
    F: FnOnce(Fix<F>) -> P,
{
    type Unfolded = P;
    
    fn unfold(self) -> P {
        (self.0)(self)
    }
}

5. Using Type-Level Indices for Recursion Variables

For protocols with multiple recursion points:

rust

struct Z; // First recursion variable
struct S<N>; // Next recursion variable

// Using de Bruijn indices for recursion variables
trait HasRecVar<N> {
    type Replace<P>: Protocol;
}

struct Rec<P: Protocol> {
    body: P,
}

struct Var<N> {
    _phantom: PhantomData<N>,
}

impl<P: Protocol> HasRecVar<Z> for Rec<P> {
    type Replace<Q> = P::Replace<Q>;
}

Practical Implementation Example

Here's a more concrete example of how you might implement a recursive ping-pong protocol:

rust

// Define our protocol states
struct PingState;
struct PongState;
struct EndState;

// Define message types
enum Message {
    Ping,
    Pong,
    End,
}

// Protocol implementation with recursion 
struct Channel<S> {
    connection: TcpStream,
    _state: PhantomData<S>,
}

impl Channel<PingState> {
    // Send a ping, transition to pong state
    fn send_ping(self) -> Channel<PongState> {
        // Send ping message
        Channel {
            connection: self.connection,
            _state: PhantomData,
        }
    }
}

impl Channel<PongState> {
    // Receive a pong, then either go back to ping state or end
    fn receive_pong(self) -> Either<Channel<PingState>, Channel<EndState>> {
        // Decide based on some condition
        if should_continue() {
            Left(Channel {
                connection: self.connection,
                _state: PhantomData,
            })
        } else {
            Right(Channel {
                connection: self.connection,
                _state: PhantomData,
            })
        }
    }
}

The key insight is that recursive session types in Rust require carefully managing ownership and state transitions at the type level. Your library should provide abstractions that make these patterns easier to use while maintaining type safety.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches or provide more detailed examples for your specific use case?

I'm interested in 3 and 4. can you elaborate each, and give show example with a ping pong protocol
Edit

I'll elaborate on approaches 3 and 4 for representing recursive session types in Rust, with concrete ping-pong protocol examples for each.
Recursive Session Types in Rust - Deep Dive

I've created a comprehensive code artifact showing both approaches in detail. Let me walk through the key concepts for each approach:
Approach 3: Higher-Ranked Trait Bounds (HRTBs) and Continuation-Passing Style

This approach uses higher-order functions to represent recursion with continuation passing style.
Key Concepts:

    Protocol Trait: Defines the protocol behavior with an associated Continue type that represents the next state.
    Mu Type: The recursion point, represented as a wrapper around a function:

rust

struct Mu<F>(PhantomData<F>);

impl<F, C: Context, P: Protocol<C>> Protocol<C> for Mu<F>
where
    F: FnOnce(Mu<F>) -> P,
{
    type Continue = P::Continue;
    
    fn execute(self, context: &mut C) -> Self::Continue {
        let protocol = (F)(self);
        protocol.execute(context)
    }
}

Protocol Construction: Creates recursive protocols by passing the recursion point to itself:

    rust

    // μX.Send<Ping>.Receive<Pong>.X
    Mu(|rec| {
        Send {
            message: PingMsg::Ping,
            next: Receive {
                _phantom: PhantomData::<PongMsg>,
                next: rec,
            },
        }
    })

Advantages:

    Uses Rust's closure system to create truly recursive types
    Separates protocol definition from execution
    Supports arbitrary recursive structures

Approach 4: Session Type Combinators with Fixed Points

This approach uses a combinator library with an explicit fixed-point operator.
Key Concepts:

    Unfold Trait: Provides the mechanism to unfold recursive definitions:

rust

trait Unfold {
    type Unfolded: Protocol;
    fn unfold(self) -> Self::Unfolded;
}

Fix Operator: Represents the fixed point of a function:

rust

struct Fix<F>(F);

impl<F, P: Protocol> Unfold for Fix<F>
where
    F: FnOnce(Fix<F>) -> P,
{
    type Unfolded = P;
    
    fn unfold(self) -> P {
        (self.0)(self)
    }
}

Protocol Combinators: Basic building blocks for creating protocols:

rust

struct Send<T, P> { message: T, next: P }
struct Receive<T, P> { _phantom: PhantomData<T>, next: P }
struct End;

Type-Level Composition:

    rust

    RecursiveProtocol(|rec| {
        Send {
            message: PingMessage,
            next: Receive {
                _phantom: PhantomData::<PongMessage>,
                next: rec,
            },
        }
    })

Enhanced: Adding Branching/Choice

In the extended example, I've also added:

    Choose and Offer combinators to represent protocol branching
    An improved ping-pong protocol with the option to terminate

rust

fn ping_client_with_stop() -> impl Protocol<Next = ()> {
    RecursiveProtocol(|rec| {
        Choose {
            choice: Either::Left(
                Send {
                    message: PingMessage,
                    next: Receive {
                        _phantom: PhantomData::<PongMessage>,
                        next: rec,
                    },
                }
            ),
        }
    })
}

Implementation Considerations

    Type Safety: Both approaches provide compile-time guarantees about protocol adherence.
    Ergonomics: The combinator approach (4) is more composable and may integrate better with a DSL.
    IO Abstraction: Note how both implementations abstract over the underlying IO mechanisms.
    Session Linearity: These implementations help enforce that each communication channel is used exactly once at each protocol step.

Which approach would you prefer to explore further? Would you like me to adapt either of these approaches to better fit your specific library requirements?

There is an error in the following generated code snippet

// Recursive protocol wrapper
struct Mu<F>(PhantomData<F>);

// Implementation for recursive protocols
impl<F, C: Context, P: Protocol<C>> Protocol<C> for Mu<F>
where
    F: FnOnce(Mu<F>) -> P,
{
    type Continue = P::Continue;
    
    fn execute(self, context: &mut C) -> Self::Continue {
        // Unfold the recursive definition once
        let protocol = (F)(self);
        // Execute the unfolded protocol
        protocol.execute(context)
    }
}

Edit

You're absolutely right. Thanks for catching that error! The issue is that I'm trying to use F as a value when it's a type parameter. Let me fix this code snippet:

Good catch! Thank you for pointing out that error. I've made several corrections to fix the recursive session type implementation:

    For Approach 3 (HRTBs and Continuation-Passing Style):
        Fixed the Mu struct to store the function directly rather than using a PhantomData
        Updated function signature in the closures to specify the type rec: Mu<_>
    For Approach 4 (Session Type Combinators with Fixed Points):
        Fixed all instances of the incorrect RecursiveProtocol with direct Fix usage
        Added type annotations to the recursive functions

These corrected implementations properly represent recursive session types in Rust. Here's a breakdown of how each approach works:
Key Differences Between the Approaches
Approach 3: Higher-Ranked Trait Bounds

This approach uses the Mu type with closures to create recursive protocols:

rust

// Define a recursive protocol with Mu
Mu(|rec: Mu<_>| {
    Send {
        message: PingMsg::Ping,
        next: Receive {
            _phantom: PhantomData::<PongMsg>,
            next: rec,  // Here's the recursion point
        },
    }
})

This approach:

    Focuses on protocol execution with the execute method
    Uses a context-based model for IO operations
    Is more execution-oriented

Approach 4: Session Type Combinators with Fixed Points

This approach uses the Fix combinator with explicit unfolding:

rust

// Define a recursive protocol with Fix
Fix(|rec: Fix<_>| {
    Send {
        message: PingMessage,
        next: Receive {
            _phantom: PhantomData::<PongMessage>,
            next: rec,  // Here's the recursion point
        },
    }
})

This approach:

    Separates the protocol definition from execution using the Unfold trait
    Creates more composable protocol definitions
    Is more amenable to static analysis and verification

Example: Ping-Pong with Termination

The enhanced example with the Choose and Offer combinators shows how to model protocols with branching decisions:

rust

Fix(|rec: Fix<_>| {
    // Choose between continuing or stopping
    Choose {
        choice: Either::Left(
            // Continue with ping-pong
            Send {
                message: PingMessage,
                next: Receive {
                    _phantom: PhantomData::<PongMessage>,
                    next: rec,
                },
            }
        ),
    }
})

This allows representing more complex protocols with decision points, which is essential for real-world communication patterns.

Would you like me to explain any specific aspect of these implementations in more detail? Or would you like to see how these patterns could be integrated with your DSL for protocol specification?

Can you elaborate what you mean by more composable protocols. Composability is essential.
Edit
Composability in Session Types

Composability is indeed essential for building complex protocol systems. When I talk about approach 4 (Session Type Combinators with Fixed Points) being more composable, I'm referring to several key aspects that make it particularly powerful for protocol design:
What Makes Protocol Definitions Composable

    Modular Construction The combinator approach allows you to build protocols from smaller, reusable pieces:

rust

// Define protocol fragments
fn authentication<P: Protocol>(next: P) -> impl Protocol<Next = P::Next> {
    Send { 
        message: UsernameMessage,
        next: Receive {
            _phantom: PhantomData::<AuthTokenMessage>,
            next
        }
    }
}

fn data_exchange<P: Protocol>(next: P) -> impl Protocol<Next = P::Next> {
    Send {
        message: DataMessage,
        next: Receive {
            _phantom: PhantomData::<AckMessage>,
            next
        }
    }
}

// Compose them into a complete protocol
fn client_protocol() -> impl Protocol<Next = ()> {
    authentication(data_exchange(End))
}

Protocol Transformers You can create higher-order functions that transform protocol behaviors:

rust

// Add encryption to any protocol
fn with_encryption<P: Protocol>(protocol: P) -> impl Protocol<Next = P::Next> {
    EncryptedWrapper { inner: protocol }
}

// Add logging to any protocol
fn with_logging<P: Protocol>(protocol: P) -> impl Protocol<Next = P::Next> {
    LoggingWrapper { inner: protocol }
}

// Use transformers on any protocol
let secure_client = with_encryption(with_logging(client_protocol()));

Parallel Composition You can compose protocols that run in parallel:

rust

struct Par<P1, P2> {
    p1: P1,
    p2: P2,
}

impl<P1: Protocol, P2: Protocol> Protocol for Par<P1, P2> {
    type Next = (P1::Next, P2::Next);
    // Implementation details...
}

// Run protocols in parallel
let parallel_protocol = Par {
    p1: ping_client(),
    p2: file_transfer_client(),
};

Sequential Composition via Continuation Passing Combinators make it easy to sequence protocols:

rust

struct Seq<P1, F> {
    first: P1,
    next_factory: F,
}

impl<P1: Protocol, F, P2: Protocol> Protocol for Seq<P1, F>
where F: FnOnce(P1::Next) -> P2 {
    type Next = P2::Next;
    
    fn run<C: Channel>(self, channel: C) -> (Self::Next, C) {
        let (result, channel) = self.first.run(channel);
        let second = (self.next_factory)(result);
        second.run(channel)
    }
}

// Sequential composition
let seq_protocol = Seq {
    first: ping_client(),
    next_factory: |_| file_transfer_client(),
};

Session Type Algebra The combinator approach enables a rich algebra of operations:

    rust

    // Protocol duality (client <-> server)
    trait Dual {
        type DualType: Protocol;
        fn dual(self) -> Self::DualType;
    }

    impl<T, P: Dual> Dual for Send<T, P> {
        type DualType = Receive<T, P::DualType>;
        
        fn dual(self) -> Self::DualType {
            Receive {
                _phantom: PhantomData,
                next: self.next.dual(),
            }
        }
    }

    // Generate server protocol from client
    let server_protocol = client_protocol().dual();

Concrete Example: Protocol Composition

Here's a more concrete example of how protocol composition would work in practice:

rust

// Protocol fragments
fn header_exchange<P: Protocol>(next: P) -> impl Protocol<Next = P::Next> {
    Send {
        message: VersionMessage { version: "1.0" },
        next: Receive {
            _phantom: PhantomData::<CapabilitiesMessage>,
            next,
        },
    }
}

fn error_handling<P: Protocol>(protocol: P) -> impl Protocol<Next = P::Next> {
    Offer {
        left: protocol,
        right: Receive {
            _phantom: PhantomData::<ErrorMessage>,
            next: End,
        },
    }
}

// Base protocols
fn ping_pong_core() -> impl Protocol<Next = ()> {
    Fix(|rec: Fix<_>| {
        Send {
            message: PingMessage,
            next: Receive {
                _phantom: PhantomData::<PongMessage>,
                next: rec,
            },
        }
    })
}

// Composed protocol with error handling and headers
fn robust_ping_pong() -> impl Protocol<Next = ()> {
    header_exchange(error_handling(ping_pong_core()))
}

Advantages for Your Library

For your multiparty session type library, this approach offers several advantages:

    Protocol Libraries: You can create reusable protocol fragments that developers can compose.
    Transport Agnosticism: The combinators are independent of the actual transport mechanism, allowing the same protocol definitions to work across HTTP, MQTT, WebSockets, etc.
    DSL Integration: The combinator approach maps naturally to a DSL syntax:

// DSL definition
protocol FileTransfer {
  Client -> Server: Request
  Server -> Client: {
    Success: Data
    Error: ErrorMessage
  }
}

// Compiles to combinator-based Rust code
fn file_transfer_client() -> impl Protocol<Next = ()> {
  Send {
    message: Request,
    next: Offer {
      left: Receive { _phantom: PhantomData::<Data>, next: End },
      right: Receive { _phantom: PhantomData::<ErrorMessage>, next: End }
    }
  }
}

Static Verification: The type system can verify protocol correctness at compile time.
Projection: You can project global protocols to local (role-specific) protocols through transformations:

    rust

    trait Project<Role> {
        type Projection: Protocol;
        fn project(self) -> Self::Projection;
    }

    // Project global protocol to client role
    let client_protocol = global_protocol.project::<ClientRole>();

This compositional approach allows developers to build complex, type-safe communication protocols from simple building blocks, while maintaining the static guarantees that make session types powerful.

Would you like me to demonstrate any specific aspect of protocol composition in more depth for your library?

Can you give an example of projection based around the ping pong example.
Edit
Protocol Projection for Multiparty Session Types

I've created an example showing how protocol projection works for a ping-pong scenario. Projection is a crucial concept in multiparty session types: it transforms a global protocol (describing the entire communication) into local protocols (describing the behavior of each participant).
How Projection Works

Protocol projection follows these core principles:

    Global vs Local View: The global protocol describes all interactions between participants, while local protocols describe the behavior of individual participants.
    Projection Rules:
        When role A sends to role B, A's projection becomes "send" and B's becomes "receive"
        When another role sends to someone else, it's omitted from your local protocol
        Recursive structures are preserved in the projection
        Choices are projected as "select" for the deciding role and "offer" for others

Ping-Pong Example Explained

In the provided artifact, I've implemented a simple projection system with these components:
1. Role Definitions

rust

// Role markers as zero-sized types
struct Client;
struct Server;

// Role trait for type-level role identification
trait Role {}
impl Role for Client {}
impl Role for Server {}

2. Global Protocol Representation

rust

enum GlobalInteraction<Next> {
    // Client to Server interaction
    ClientToServer {
        msg_type: &'static str,
        continuation: Next,
    },
    // Server to Client interaction
    ServerToClient {
        msg_type: &'static str,
        continuation: Next,
    },
    // Recursive point in the protocol
    Rec {
        body: Box<GlobalInteraction<Next>>,
    },
    // Variable reference to recursive point
    Var,
    // End of protocol
    End,
}

3. Local Protocol Representation

rust

enum LocalProtocol<R: Role> {
    // Send a message
    Send {
        to_role: &'static str,
        msg_type: &'static str,
        continuation: Box<LocalProtocol<R>>,
    },
    // Receive a message
    Receive {
        from_role: &'static str,
        msg_type: &'static str,
        continuation: Box<LocalProtocol<R>>,
    },
    // Recursive point
    Rec {
        body: Box<LocalProtocol<R>>,
    },
    // Variable reference
    Var,
    // End of protocol
    End,

4. Projection Implementation

The core of projection is a trait that transforms global protocols to local protocols:

rust

trait Project<R: Role> {
    type Output;
    fn project(self) -> Self::Output;
}

impl<Next> Project<Client> for GlobalInteraction<Next> 
where
    Next: Project<Client>,
{
    type Output = LocalProtocol<Client>;
    
    fn project(self) -> Self::Output {
        match self {
            GlobalInteraction::ClientToServer { msg_type, continuation } => {
                LocalProtocol::Send {
                    to_role: "Server",
                    msg_type,
                    continuation: Box::new(continuation.project()),
                }
            },
            GlobalInteraction::ServerToClient { msg_type, continuation } => {
                LocalProtocol::Receive {
                    from_role: "Server",
                    msg_type,
                    continuation: Box::new(continuation.project()),
                }
            },
            // ... other cases
        }
    }
}

5. Example Usage

rust

// Define a ping-pong protocol (global view)
let ping_pong_protocol = GlobalProtocolBuilder::new()
    .rec(|var| {
        var.client_to_server("Ping")
           .server_to_client("Pong")
    })
    .build();

// Project to client role
let client_protocol = ping_pong_protocol.project::<Client>();

// Project to server role
let server_protocol = ping_pong_protocol.project::<Server>();

Output of the Example

When executed, this code would produce:

Client Protocol:
Client: Rec {
  Client: Send Ping to Server
  Client: Receive Pong from Server
  Client: Var
}

Server Protocol:
Server: Rec {
  Server: Receive Ping from Client
  Server: Send Pong to Client
  Server: Var
}

Extended Example with Choices

I've also included an extended example showing how choice/branching would work in the projection system. This is particularly important for real-world protocols where different paths can be taken:

rust

// For a global protocol:
// rec X {
//   Client -> Server: Ping;
//   Server -> Client: Pong;
//   choice at Client {
//     Client -> Server: Continue;
//     continue X;
//   } or {
//     Client -> Server: Stop;
//     end;
//   }
// }

The client projection becomes:

rust

// Client projection:
// rec X {
//   send Ping to Server;
//   receive Pong from Server;
//   select at Server {
//     send Continue to Server;
//     continue X;
//   } or {
//     send Stop to Server;
//     end;
//   }
// }

And the server projection becomes:

rust

// Server projection:
// rec X {
//   receive Ping from Client;
//   send Pong to Client;
//   offer from Client {
//     receive Continue from Client;
//     continue X;
//   } or {
//     receive Stop from Client;
//     end;
//   }
// }

Integration into Your Library

For your multiparty session type library, this projection system would:

    Allow users to define a global protocol once
    Automatically generate role-specific code for each participant
    Ensure type safety and protocol conformance at compile time
    Integrate with your DSL for protocol specification

The DSL integration would look something like:

rust

#[global_protocol(PingPong)]
protocol! {
    rec X {
        Client -> Server: Ping;
        Server -> Client: Pong;
        continue X;
    }
}

// Usage:
let client = project::<Client>(PingPong);
let server = project::<Server>(PingPong);

This projection system forms the cornerstone of multiparty session types, enabling you to statically verify that each participant's implementation adheres to their part of the protocol.

Would you like me to explain any particular aspect of the projection system in more detail?
