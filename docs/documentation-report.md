# Documentation Review Report

This report summarizes the findings from the review of external documentation files and internal code docstrings for the Sessrums project.

## External Files Documentation

### File Purposes

Based on filenames, the markdown files in `docs/` serve the following purposes:

*   `api-ergonomics.md`: Discusses API usability design.
*   `error-handling.md`: Explains error management.
*   `index.md`: Main documentation entry point.
*   `mpst-concepts.md`: Core MPST concepts.
*   `mpst-design.md`: MPST implementation design decisions.
*   `mpst-macro.md`: Documentation for the MPST macro.
*   `mpst-overview.md`: High-level overview of MPST features.
*   `mpst-plan.md`: Roadmap for MPST development.
*   `mpst-pubsub.md`: Intended for publish/subscribe patterns (currently missing content).
*   `mpst-research-notes.md`: Research notes on MPST.
*   `offer-choose.md`: Explains offer/choose branching.
*   `quick-reference.md`: Concise guide/cheat sheet.
*   `session-types-diagram.svg`: SVG diagram for session types.
*   `session-types-diagrams.md`: Embeds/explains session type diagrams.
*   `session-types-documentation.md`: General session types documentation.
*   `testing-protocols.md`: How to test protocols.

### Key Issues Summary

*   **MPST Status Inconsistency:** Files like `session-types-documentation.md` and `mpst-overview.md` describe MPST features as existing, while `mpst-plan.md` indicates they are planned. This needs alignment.
*   **Redundancy/Structure:** Overlapping content exists (e.g., MPST concepts spread across multiple files). The overall structure could be streamlined.
*   **Broken Links:** `index.md` contains broken links.
*   **Internal Detail Exposure:** `offer-choose.md` exposes internal implementation details unnecessarily.
*   **Placeholders/Missing Content:** Placeholder types (`<Type>`) are used, and `mpst-pubsub.md` lacks content.
*   **Style Variation:** Inconsistent writing style and formatting across files.
*   **Examples:** Lack of clear, practical examples in some areas.

## Code Docstrings

### Module/Area Summary

*   **Binary Protocols (`proto/send.rs`, `proto/recv.rs`, etc.):** Generally well-documented.
*   **Global Protocols (`proto/global.rs`):** Documentation is incomplete, containing placeholders and lacking detail on validation, projection logic, and role involvement.
*   **Projection (`proto/projection.rs`):** Both the implementation logic and corresponding documentation are incomplete.
*   **Channels (`chan/mod.rs`):** Lacks practical examples. Contains conflicting documentation regarding channel behavior and mentions disabled features (`Inc`/`Dec`) without clear status.
*   **Macros (`sessrums-macro/`):** Generally well-documented, but the `protocol_pair!` macro's test is commented out, raising questions about its status.
*   **Connect (`connect.rs`):** Lacks examples and documentation regarding serialization/deserialization aspects.
*   **Supporting Modules (e.g., `error.rs`, `roles.rs`):** Mostly adequate documentation.

### Key Issues Summary

*   **Incompleteness:** Significant gaps exist, especially for global protocols, projection logic, and channel usage. Many TODOs and placeholders remain.
*   **Lack of Examples:** Key areas like channels (`chan/mod.rs`) and connection setup (`connect.rs`) lack practical code examples.
*   **Accuracy/Consistency:** Conflicting statements in `chan/mod.rs` docs. The status of features mentioned (e.g., `Inc`/`Dec`, `protocol_pair!`) is unclear.
*   **Unimplemented/Disabled Features:** Documentation mentions features that appear incomplete or disabled without clarifying their current state or future plans.

## Suggestions for Improvement

### External Files

1.  **Consolidate & Restructure:** Review files like `mpst-concepts.md`, `mpst-design.md`, `mpst-overview.md`, and `session-types-documentation.md`. Consolidate overlapping information and create a clearer, more logical structure (e.g., a single MPST section).
2.  **Align MPST Content:** Ensure all documentation accurately reflects the current implementation status of MPST features. Update `mpst-plan.md` or remove descriptions of planned features from other documents.
3.  **Fix Broken Links:** Audit and repair all broken links, starting with `index.md`.
4.  **Refine Content:** Remove internal implementation details from user-facing docs like `offer-choose.md`. Replace placeholders like `<Type>` with actual types or clear explanations.
5.  **Add Missing Content:** Create the content for `mpst-pubsub.md` or remove the file if the feature is not planned.
6.  **Standardize Style:** Apply a consistent writing style, formatting (headings, code blocks), and tone across all documents.
7.  **Improve Examples:** Add clear, practical code examples where needed.

### Docstrings

1.  **Complete Global Protocol Docs:** Fill in the missing details in `proto/global.rs` regarding validation, projection, and role interactions. Remove placeholders.
2.  **Clarify Projection:** Complete the implementation and documentation for `proto/projection.rs`.
3.  **Enhance Channel Docs:** Add practical usage examples to `chan/mod.rs`. Resolve conflicting documentation statements. Clarify the status of `Inc`/`Dec` features (are they deprecated, planned, experimental?).
4.  **Address `connect.rs`:** Provide examples for establishing connections and document the serialization/deserialization process clearly.
5.  **Clarify Macro Status:** Determine the status of `protocol_pair!` and either fix the test or update the documentation to reflect its state (e.g., experimental, deprecated).
6.  **Review TODOs:** Address or remove TODO comments throughout the codebase docstrings.
7.  **Document Disabled Features:** Clearly state the status of any features mentioned in docs but not fully implemented or currently disabled.
