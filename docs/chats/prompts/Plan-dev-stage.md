Given @/docs/chats/MPST_DSL-Review\ AndImplementation.md  develop a detailed implementation plan for Stage 6 and write it to @docs/Stages/Stage6.md. Please see the examples of @/docs/Stages/Stage1.md and @/docs/Stages/Stage2.md .
Take into account @/docs/SessionTypeCombinatorsWithFixedPoint.md .

The plan should be split into small self-contained tasks. The plan and each task should include pre-conditions, post-conditions ( ideally tests.).

The goal is to implement the planned code, tests and documentaion and verify it usng tests.

Do not develop any code, just plan.
