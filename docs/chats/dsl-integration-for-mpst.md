## DSL Integration for Multiparty Session Types

Your DSL should provide an intuitive way to express complex protocols while generating the type-level representations needed for compile-time verification. The artifact shows a comprehensive approach to implementing this.

### Key DSL Components

1. **Protocol Declaration Syntax** - A Mermaid-like syntax for defining multiparty protocols with roles, messages, choices, and recursion
2. **Proc Macro Transformation** - Converting DSL specifications into type-level representations:

```rust

    #[protocol]
    pub const FILE_TRANSFER: &str = r#"
    protocol FileTransfer {
        participant Client
        participant Server
        ...
    }
    "#;
```
3. **Projection Generation** - Automatically deriving role-specific local protocols from the global specification
4. **Transport-Agnostic Sessions** - Creating session objects that enforce protocol adherence while abstracting transport details

## Combining Patterns with DSL

The DSL translates to the combinator pattern you described earlier:

1. **DSL Surface Syntax**:

```protocol PingPong {
  rec Loop {
    Client -> Server: Ping
    Server -> Client: Pong
    continue Loop
  }
}
```

2. **Generated Combinator Code**:

```rust

    fn ping_pong_protocol() -> impl GlobalProtocol {
        rec(|var| {
            message::<Client, Server, Ping>(
                message::<Server, Client, Pong>(var)
            )
        })
    }
```

Your DSL can support composition through protocol fragments, transformers, and the session type algebra you described.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the DSL integration or provide more detailed examples for a particular pattern?
