# MPST Research Notes (Internal Analysis)

Based on the existing `sessrums` documentation (`docs/mpst-concepts.md` and `docs/mpst-design.md`), this document summarizes potential insights relevant to the planned internal implementation of Multiparty Session Types (MPST).

*   **Complexity of Global Protocol Representation:** Defining complex global protocols using nested Rust types can be verbose. The planned `global_protocol!` macro is crucial for providing a more intuitive domain-specific language (DSL) to simplify this definition.
*   **Core Projection Logic:** The central technical challenge lies in implementing the projection mechanism to derive local protocols from the global definition. This requires careful type-level programming to correctly translate each global protocol element's view for different roles.
*   **Integration with Binary Types:** A key aspect is the seamless mapping of projected local MPST types to the existing `sessrums` binary session types (`SendChannel`, `RecvChannel`, `Offer`, `Choose`, etc.) to leverage the current runtime infrastructure while maintaining type safety.
*   **Handling of Choice and Recursion:** Implementing the type-level representation and projection for branching (`GChoice`, `GOffer`) and recursion (`GRec`, `GVar`) requires careful design to ensure correctness and compile-time verification.
*   **Clear Error Reporting:** Defining specific error types for issues like projection failures or protocol mismatches will be important for providing actionable feedback to users during compilation.
