//! Protocol 4: Simple Authentication
//!
//! # Protocol Description
//!
//! This example demonstrates a simple authentication protocol where:
//! - Client sends a username (String)
//! - Client sends a password (String)
//! - Server receives the username
//! - Server receives the password
//! - Server sends an authentication token (u128)
//! - Client receives the authentication token
//! - Both sides close the connection
//!
//! # Session Type Safety
//!
//! This protocol demonstrates several key aspects of session type safety:
//!
//! 1. **Type-level Protocol Definition**: The protocol is defined at the type level using
//!    `Send<T, P>`, `Recv<T, P>`, and `End` types, ensuring that the communication sequence
//!    is enforced by the Rust type system.
//!
//! 2. **Duality**: The client and server protocols are duals of each other, ensuring
//!    that they can communicate without deadlocks or protocol violations. When the client
//!    sends, the server must be ready to receive; when the server sends, the client must
//!    be ready to receive.
//!
//! 3. **Type Safety**: The protocol ensures that the correct types are sent and received
//!    at each step. The client must send a username (String) followed by a password (String),
//!    and then receive a token (u128). The server must receive a username (String) followed
//!    by a password (String), and then send a token (u128).
//!
//! 4. **Protocol Completion**: Both sides must follow the protocol to completion, ending
//!    with the `End` type, which ensures that no communication is left hanging.

//! # Type-Level Representation
//!
//! ```
//! Client: Send<String, Send<String, Recv<u128, End>>>
//! Server: Recv<String, Recv<String, Send<u128, End>>>
//! ```
//!
//! This demonstrates how the types mirror the communication flow and ensure
//! protocol adherence at compile time. The client sends a username and password,
//! then receives a token, while the server receives a username and password,
//! then sends a token.
