//! Protocol 2: Request/Response
//!
//! # Protocol Description
//!
//! This example demonstrates a request/response protocol where:
//! - Client sends a String request
//! - Server receives the String request
//! - Server sends a boolean response
//! - Client receives the boolean response
//! - Both sides close the connection
//!
//! # Session Type Safety
//!
//! This protocol demonstrates several key aspects of session type safety:
//!
//! 1. **Type-level Protocol Definition**: The protocol is defined at the type level using
//!    `Send<T, P>`, `Recv<T, P>`, and `End` types, ensuring that the communication
//!    sequence is enforced by the Rust type system.
//!
//! 2. **Duality**: The client and server protocols are duals of each other, ensuring
//!    that they can communicate without deadlocks or protocol violations. When the client
//!    sends, the server receives; when the server sends, the client receives.
//!
//! 3. **Type Safety**: The protocol ensures that the correct types are sent and received
//!    at each step. The client must send a String request, and the server must respond with a boolean.
//!
//! 4. **Protocol Completion**: Both sides must follow the protocol to completion, ending
//!    with the `End` type, which ensures that no communication is left hanging.

//! # Type-Level Representation
//!
//! ```
//! Client: Send<String, Recv<bool, End>>
//! Server: Recv<String, Send<bool, End>>
//! ```
//!
//! This demonstrates how the types mirror the communication flow and ensure
//! protocol adherence at compile time.
